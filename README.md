# Drobot

Drobot is Dronir's awesome IRC bot / Ruby programming exercise, built using
the `cinch` bot building framework.


# Functions

- The owner (hardcoded to *!dronir@kapsi.fi) can order the bot to join a channel
  with by addressing it like "Drobot: join #foo" and part a channel by saying
  "Drobot: part [#foo]", where the channel name is optional (defaults to current channel).
